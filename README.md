# Gammapy_analysis

This repository provides the code and notebooks used for my Master's thesis work. 

## Contents

1. Pulsar Data Processing
    - `Addphase.ipynb` – Adds pulsar phase information to DL3 FITS files by matching event IDs from melibea ROOT files  
    - `Data_reduction.ipynb` – Performs data reduction for pulsar DL3 data

2. Flux Point Estimation: **MCMC technique with Tikhonov Regularization** for flux point estimation in Gammapy  
    - Implementation: `mcmc_reg.py`  (Built on an existing script from the [Gammapy Recipes](https://gammapy.github.io/gammapy-recipes/_build/html/notebooks/mcmc-sampling-emcee/mcmc_sampling.html) on MCMC sampling)
    - Example use: `Example_flux_estimation_mcmc_reg.ipynb`  
    - Method details: `Details_and_performance.ipynb`  
    - `find_opt.py` : helps to determine the optimal regularization depth

## Flux Point Estimation: Stepped Power Law Model + MCMC Sampling with Tikhonov Regularization

- It is based on the **stepped power law model**, proposed to address two main **issues** in Gammapy's standard `FluxPointEstimator`:  &nbsp;
  
    - Its dependence on a predefined reference spectrum, which may introduce unwanted correlations.
  
    - Its operation in the reconstructed energy space, rather than the true energy space, which can lead to
unreliable results on the edge of the underlying spectrum

- Directly fitting the model parameters resulted in large uncertainties and correlations between adjacent energy bins, due to the **ill-posed** nature of the problem. Therefore, the **Tikhonov regularization term** was introduced to obtain reliable results
